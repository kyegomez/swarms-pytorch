| **Routing Mechanisms** | Gating Networks          | Determines which expert handles which part of the input, typically using learnable parameters.        | Used in nearly all MoE models for efficient expert utilization. |
|                      | Top-k Gating             | Routes each input to the top k experts based on gating scores, promoting specialization.             | Enhances capacity and efficiency in large-scale models. |
|                      | Sparse Gating            | Routes inputs to a small subset of experts, ensuring sparse connectivity for scalability.             | Useful in scaling MoE models for high-dimensional data. |
| **Expert Architecture** | Feedforward Networks     | Standard architecture for individual experts, consisting of one or more fully connected layers.       | Common in basic MoE implementations for simple tasks. |
|                      | Convolutional Experts    | Experts use convolutional layers, ideal for spatial data like images.                                 | Applied in computer vision tasks within MoE frameworks. |
|                      | Recurrent Experts        | Utilizes RNNs or LSTMs for experts, suitable for sequential data.                                     | Effective in NLP and time-series analysis in MoE models. |
| **Load Balancing**     | Auxiliary Loss           | An additional loss term to encourage even distribution of workload among experts.                     | Addresses the load imbalance issue in MoE models. |
|                      | Capacity Loss            | Penalizes over-utilization of any single expert, promoting equal usage.                               | Further mitigates load imbalance in large MoE networks. |
| **Training Strategies** | Gradient Blending        | Combines gradients from different experts efficiently for backpropagation.                            | Essential for stable and efficient training of MoE models. |
|                      | Expert Dropout           | Randomly drops experts during training to promote robustness and prevent overfitting.                 | Increases generalization and model robustness. |
| **Optimization Techniques** | Expert Pruning           | Removes less utilized experts from the model post-training for efficiency.                            | Reduces computational overhead in deployed models. |
|                      | Adaptive Computation     | Dynamically adjusts the computational effort based on the input complexity.                           | Optimizes computational resources during inference. |
