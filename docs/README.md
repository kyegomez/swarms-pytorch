# 10 swarming neural network algorithms, with brief overviews, algorithmic pseudocode, and potential use cases for each:

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
    - **Overview**: Simulates the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It adjusts trajectories of individual agents (particles) based on their own and their neighbors' best known positions.
    - **Pseudocode**:
        ```
        Initialize each particle with random position and velocity
        while not converged:
            for each particle:
                calculate fitness value
                if fitness better than its best, update its best
            end for
            for each particle:
                update velocity towards its best and global best
                update position
            end for
        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Function optimization, neural network training, feature selection.

2. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
    - **Overview**: Simulates the foraging behavior of ants to find paths through graphs. Uses pheromones to mark good paths, which evaporate over time.
    - **Pseudocode**:
        ```
        Initialize pheromones on paths
        while not converged:
            deploy ants to find paths based on pheromone strengths
            update pheromone strengths based on quality of paths
            evaporate some pheromone
        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Path finding, traveling salesman problem, network routing.

3. **Bee Algorithm (BA)**
    - **Overview**: Simulates the behavior of honey bees finding optimal nectar sources.
    - **Pseudocode**:
        ```
        Initialize scout bees randomly
        while not converged:
            deploy scout bees to search for nectar
            recruit forager bees based on nectar quality
            more foragers for better nectar sources
        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Job scheduling, function optimization, image processing.

4. **Firefly Algorithm (FA)**
    - **Overview**: Based on the flashing behavior of fireflies. Fireflies are attracted to each other depending on the brightness of their flashing.

        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Multi-modal optimization, feature selection, clustering.

5. **Bat Algorithm (BA)**
    - **Overview**: Inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. Bats fly randomly and adjust positions based on emitted and returned echoes.
    - **Pseudocode**:
        ```
        Initialize bats with random positions and velocities
        while not converged:
            for each bat:
                adjust velocity based on echolocation feedback
                move bat

            calculate fitness of all wolves
            rank wolves: alpha, beta, delta, and omega
            adjust position of omega wolves towards alpha, beta, and delta
        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Neural network training, function optimization, game AI.

7. **Fish School Search (FSS)**
    - **Overview**: Simulates the social behavior of fish schooling.
    - **Pseudocode**:

        while not converged:
            for each fish:
                if neighbor has better food, move towards it
                else explore randomly
            end for
            adjust school behavior based on total food
        end while
        ```
    - **Use Cases**: Load balancing, function optimization, robotics.

8. **Cuckoo Search (CS)**
    - **Overview**: Based on the reproduction strategy of cuckoos. They lay eggs in host bird nests and those nests with the best eggs (solutions) will carry on to the next generation.
    - **Pseudocode**:
        ```
        Initialize host nests with eggs (solutions)
        while not converged:
            lay new eggs by Levy flights
            if new egg better than the worst in nest, replace it
            discover a fraction of nests and lay new eggs
        end while

9. **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)**
    - **Overview**: Simulates the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales.

        ```
        Initialize whales
        while not converged:
