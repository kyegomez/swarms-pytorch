# Swarms in Torch
An experimental repository that houses swarming algorithms like PSO, Ant Colony, Sakana, and more in PyTorch primitivesðŸ˜Š

# Benefits
- Easy to use
- Extreme reliability
- 100% Novel Architectures
- Minimal APIs
- Seamless Experience

## Installation

You can install the package using pip

```bash
pip3 install swarms-torch
```

# Usage

### ParticleSwarmOptimization

```python
from swarms_torch import ParticleSwarmOptimization

#test
pso = ParticleSwarmOptimization(goal="Attention is all you need", n_particles=100)
pso.optimize(iterations=1000)
```

### Ant Colony Optimization
```python
from swarms_torch.ant_colony_swarm import AntColonyOptimization

# Usage:
goal_string = "Hello ACO"
aco = AntColonyOptimization(goal_string, num_iterations=1000)
best_solution = aco.optimize()
print("Best Matched String:", best_solution)

```

### Neural Network with Transformers as synapases
```python
import torch
from swarms_torch.nnt import NNTransformer

x = torch.randn(1, 10)

network = NNTransformer(
    #transformer cells
    neuron_count = 5, 
    
    #num states
    num_states = 10,

    #input dim
    input_dim = 10,

    #output dim
    output_dim = 10,

    #nhead
    nhead = 2,
)
output = network(x)
print(output)
```

### CellularSwarm
a Cellular Neural Net with transformers as cells, time simulation, and a local neighboorhood!

```python
from swarms_torch import CellularSwarm 

x = torch.randn(10, 32, 512)  # sequence length of 10, batch size of 32, embedding size of 512
model = CellularSwarm(cell_count=5, input_dim=512, nhead=8)
output = model(x)

```
### Fish School/Sakana
- An all-new innovative approaches to machine learning that leverage the power of the Transformer model architecture. These systems are designed to mimic the behavior of a school of fish, where each fish represents an individual Transformer model. The goal is to optimize the performance of the entire school by learning from the best-performing fish.

```python
import torch
from swarms_torch.fish_school import Fish, FishSchool

# Create random source and target sequences
src = torch.randn(10, 32, 512)
tgt = torch.randn(10, 32, 512)

# Create random labels
labels = torch.randint(0, 512, (10, 32))

# Create a fish and train it on the random data
fish = Fish(512, 8, 6)
fish.train(src, tgt, labels)
print(fish.food)  # Print the fish's food

# Create a fish school and optimize it on the random data
school = FishSchool(10, 512, 8, 6, 100)
school.forward(src, tgt, labels)
print(school.fish[0].food)  # Print the first fish's food

```

### Swarmalators
```python
from swarms_torch import visualize_swarmalators, simulate_swarmalators

# Init for Swarmalator
# Example usage:
N = 100
J, alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon_a, epsilon_r, R = [0.1] * 7
D = 3  # Ensure D is an integer
xi, sigma_i = simulate_swarmalators(
    N, J, alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon_a, epsilon_r, R, D
)


# Call the visualization function
visualize_swarmalators(xi)

```

# Playground
- There are various scripts in the playground folder with various examples for each swarm, like ant colony and fish school and spiral optimization.

# Todo
- [Check out the project board](https://github.com/users/kyegomez/projects/9/views/1)
- make training script ready for fish school with autoregressive,
- practical examples of training models and conduct interence
- upload to huggingface a small model
- train fish school, neural transformer, and pso transformer,
